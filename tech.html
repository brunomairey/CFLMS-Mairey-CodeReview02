            <h3>JavaScript Versus Java</h3>

            <br>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are two different computer languages, both developed in 1995. Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it can run independently in a machine environment. It is a reliable, versatile language used for Android apps, enterprise systems that move large amounts of data (especially in the finance industry), and embedded functions for "Internet of Things" technologies (IoT).

                JavaScript, on the other hand, is a text-based programming language meant to run as part of a web-based application. When first developed, it was intended to be a compliment to Java. But JavaScript took on a life of its own as one of the three pillars of web development—the other two being HTML and CSS. Unlike Java applications, which need to be compiled before they can run in a web-based environment, JavaScript was purposely designed to integrate into HTML. All major web browsers support JavaScript, though most give users the option of disabling support for itSteven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology.
